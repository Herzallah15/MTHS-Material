Using the path integral formalism of quantum field theory, one notices that physical observables are independent of field redefinitions 
$\phi\rightarrow\phi+f(\phi/\Lambda)$, where $\Lambda$ is a dimensionful parameter. This redefinition does not affect observables, because the integration in the generating functional $Z[J]$ is done over all configurations of $\phi$ and the measure $\mathcal{D}\phi$ compensates any changes of variables due to the Jacobian.  Note that one can drop the additional interpolating field in the part containing the external current $J$ (and work just with $J\phi$) without changing the S-matrix (though Green's functions do change!).
